*signauth* is a deep learning model built using pytorch which can authenticate handwritten signatures using cnn image classification. Model can differentiate between fake and real handwritten signatures. Model is also available in tensorflow lite format for building and binding on mobile devices.

For more precision model uses image of **256x256** pixels, this cause in higher model sizes but accuracy at human level is more.

Model needs labels for every signatures (*supervised learning*). If model is trained with low data it will cause lack in accuracy. When trained with two signs, if third unknown unclassified sign is passed to model then prediction is very bad. It classifies sign from one of the classes from present classes.

The development handwritten signatures dataset is used from [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/divyanshrai/handwritten-signatures "dataset") datasets.


## Getting Started

Default images are labeled as XXXYYZZZ

- XXX -> person id who signed
- YY -> number of sign
- ZZZ -> real person id who has this signature style

So if XXX equal ZZZ then it is a real signature, and if XXX notequal to ZZZ then it is a fake signature.

You can run the below commands to test out the model or [open in colab](https://colab.research.google.com/github/360modder/signauth/blob/master/others/SignAuth_Google_Colab.ipynb).

```bash
git clone https://www.github.com/360modder/signauth.git
cd signauth
pip install -r requirements.txt
python preprocessing/preprocessor.py --process=train,test,predict --backup --overwrite
python train.py
python predict.py
```

The main model.py or the model class is situated [here](https://www.github.com/360modder/signauth/blob/master/models/__init__.py "__init__.py") or simply **models/__init__.py** in this file.


## CLI Tools

For more easy usage of program is divided into modules and created in cli interface mode. Some of tools you can access are, 

```bash
python train.py -h
python preprocessing/preprocessor.py -h
```


## Training

Training model is very easy, you have to place your images in following steps.

1. Gather signature images (prefer size 256x256)
2. Create a folder and name it as same as the label for sign image
3. Place all image files in that folder
4. Place this folder inside **data/train/[foldername i.e. label]/**
5. Do same or split files from there and do same for test images

If images are non-uniform you can run.

```bash
python preprocessing/preprocessor.py --backup
```

> Note: Use **--scan** flag in above command to apply scan effect to signature images for more precision in some cases.

After prepration of data you run in command line.

```bash
python train.py --classes=2 --update
```


## Predictions (Classifications)

Once you train a model, then you have to place your source images (256x256) in **data/predict** directory the run command.

```bash
python predict.py
```

If images are not of 256x256 or any other issue you can place them inside **data/predict** folder then run this command.

```bash
python preprocessing/preprocessor.py --process=predict --scan --backup
```

This will reshape images into ascpect ratio 1:1 and resize them to 256x256 with a scan filter for model.


## Tensorflow Lite Model

Once you have trained a model it is generated in models directory under name *model.pth*. To convert this model to tensorflow lite model first install all dependencies then run the following commands.

The model conversion chain is followed as *pytorch -> onnx -> tf -> tflite*.

```bash
python models/tflite.py
```

This command will create a tflite model in models directory. You can further tweak models/tflite.py for more advanced conversions.


## TODO

- fixing predictions for an unclassified sign
- better model with higher accuracy and more correct and precise predictions (classifications)
